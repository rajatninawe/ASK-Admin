## Getting started

`git clone https://github.com/rajatninawe/fb_admin.git cd my-project npm install ng serve`

After that,\
Step 1: Create a Firebase project and register your app.
        Before you can add Firebase to your JavaScript app, you need to create a Firebase project and register your app with that project. When you register your app with                 Firebase, you'll get a Firebase configuration object that you'll use to connect your app with your Firebase project resources.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
